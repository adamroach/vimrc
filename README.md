# vimrc
Just a place to store the .vimrc file that I use everwhere. This file has evolved
over many years, and has lots of random cruft accumulated in it. But it gets the
job done, and I want someplace to store it that I can grab from any new computer,
and that I can use to keep my changes in sync between computers.

You might find it useful. You might find it infuriating. I make no promises.

If you get a ton of `E319: Sorry, the command is not available in this version` messages, it's probably because you have `vim-tiny` installed. To fix this on Ubuntu, do `sudo apt remove vim-tiny; sudo install vim-gtk3`
